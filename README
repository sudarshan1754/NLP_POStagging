I have made use of Python 2.7.3 programming/scripting environment.
Note: It is better to use an IDE such as Pycharm to run the program. You can download the
      free(community edition) version of the IDE from this link:
      http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Before running the program, please install the Natural Language Toolkit from this link:
http://www.nltk.org/install.html

"POSTagging.py" file is the executable file which contains the program for this assignment.

Execution:
    In the terminal type: python POSTagging.py

       This will list the options to:
       1. Train the Model
       2. Test the Language Model on a file
       3. Evaluate
       4. Exit

    For training, enter "1", this will ask you for the training filename (please make
    sure your file is in the same folder as the POSTagging.py). Next it will ask you for the
    name of the language model file. Once this is entered, the training begins. And
    the progress will be displayed along with the training time, once completed.

    For testing, enter "2", this will ask you for the language model filename (please
    make sure your file is in the same folder as the POSTagging.py). Next it will ask you
    for the test file name (please make sure your file is in the same folder as the
    POSTagging.py). Then it will ask you for the test tag file name (output). Once this
    is provided, the testing begins.

    Note: Testing a large file will take anywhere between 15~25 minutes.

    For evaluation, enter "3", this will ask you for the tagged file name, i.e, the output
    file of testing phase (please make sure your file is in the same folder as the
    POSTagging.py). Next it will ask you for the reference file name. The evaluation
    results will be displayed in the terminal.

    To exit the program enter "4".

Notes:
    1. To identify the unknown tags for evaluation, I have appended ">>" to the tag in
    the testing phase. Example: "CD>>"
